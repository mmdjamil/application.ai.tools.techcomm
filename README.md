## 📖 Overview

`application.ai.tools.techcomm` is a productivity tool for technical communicators. It takes a document you upload (Word, PDF, PowerPoint, or Excel) and produces two clear reports:

1. **Inclusive Language Scan** — flags non‑inclusive terms (e.g. *blacklist*, *whitelist*, *master*, *slave*) and recommends inclusive replacements.
2. **Broken Link Check** — extracts every `http(s)://` link in the document and verifies each one in parallel, reporting HTTP status, timeouts, and connection errors.

Both reports include the **page/section and line number** where each issue was found, and can be downloaded as CSV for further triage.

## ✨ Features

- 📂 **Multi‑format document parsing**
  - Microsoft Word (`.docx`) — paragraphs and tables
  - PDF (`.pdf`) — page‑by‑page, line‑by‑line
  - PowerPoint (`.pptx`) — slides, shapes, and tables
  - Excel (`.xlsx`) — every sheet and row
- 🔤 **Non‑inclusive language detection** with case‑insensitive whole‑word matching and suggested replacements.
- 🔗 **Concurrent link checking** (10 workers) using HEAD requests with automatic GET fallback, custom User‑Agent, and 10s timeout.
- 📊 **Summary metrics** — word count, compliance rate, total links, broken links.
- 📥 **CSV export** of both inclusive scan and link check results.
- 🚀 **Simple Streamlit UI** — drag, drop, scan.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python **3.9 or later**
- `pip` (or `uv` / `poetry` if you prefer)

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mmdjamil/application.ai.tools.techcomm.git
cd application.ai.tools.techcomm

# 2. (Recommended) create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # macOS / Linux
# .venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Then open the URL Streamlit prints (typically <http://localhost:8501>) in your browser.

## 🧭 How to Use

1. **Upload** a `.docx`, `.pdf`, `.pptx`, or `.xlsx` file (up to 200 MB).
2. Choose what to scan:
   - ✅ Non‑Inclusive Language Scan
   - ✅ Broken Link Check
3. Click **🚀 Start Scan**.
4. Review the results inline and click **📥 Download** to export them as CSV.

## 🔤 Inclusive Language Rules

The default ruleset is defined in [`scanners/inclusive_scanner.py`](scanners/inclusive_scanner.py):

| Found Term  | Suggested Replacement     |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| `blacklist` | `denylist`                |
| `whitelist` | `allowlist`               |
| `master`    | `primary / initiator`     |
| `slave`     | `secondary / target`      |

Matching is **case‑insensitive** and uses **whole‑word boundaries** (`\b`) to avoid false positives.

### Add your own terms

Edit the `NON_INCLUSIVE_TERMS` dictionary in `scanners/inclusive_scanner.py`:

```python
NON_INCLUSIVE_TERMS = {
    "blacklist":  "denylist",
    "whitelist":  "allowlist",
    "master":     "primary / initiator",
    "slave":      "secondary / target",
    # Add new entries here
    "dummy":      "placeholder",
}
```

## 🔗 Link Checking Details

- URLs are extracted with the regex `https?://[^\s<>"\'\)\],;|\\}]+`.
- Each link is first probed with **HEAD**; if the server returns ≥ 400, the checker falls back to **GET** (streaming).
- Requests use a custom User‑Agent (`Mozilla/5.0 (DocScanner/1.0)`) with a **10‑second timeout** and follow redirects.
- A link is reported **broken** when:
  - HTTP status ≥ 400, **or**
  - the request times out, **or**
  - a connection / generic request error occurs.
- Up to **10 links are checked concurrently** via `ThreadPoolExecutor`.

## 🧩 Programmatic Use

You can also call the scanner modules directly without Streamlit:

```python
from scanners import parse_file, scan_for_inclusive_language, check_all_links

with open("my_doc.docx", "rb") as f:
    parsed = parse_file(f.read(), "my_doc.docx")

inclusive = scan_for_inclusive_language(parsed)
print(inclusive["total_non_inclusive_count"], "non-inclusive terms found")

links = check_all_links(parsed)
print(links["broken_link_count"], "broken links")
```

Each parsed entry has the shape:

```python
{"page": int, "line": int, "text": str}
```

## 📦 Dependencies

Defined in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt):

| Package        | Purpose                                  |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| `streamlit`    | Web UI                                   |
| `python-docx`  | Read `.docx` files                       |
| `pdfplumber`   | Read `.pdf` files                        |
| `python-pptx`  | Read `.pptx` files                       |
| `openpyxl`     | Read `.xlsx` files                       |
| `requests`     | HTTP link checking                       |
| `pandas`       | Tabular results & CSV export             |

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- **`Unsupported file type`** — only `.docx`, `.pdf`, `.pptx`, and `.xlsx` are supported. Convert other formats first.
- **Many links reported as broken** — some sites block `HEAD`/automated requests or are behind authentication. Verify in a browser.
- **Slow scan on large PDFs** — parsing time scales with document length; the link check is parallelized but still bound by remote server response times.
- **Password‑protected or scanned (image‑only) PDFs** — text cannot be extracted; OCR is not currently supported.

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap Ideas

- Configurable / external rule file (YAML/JSON) for inclusive terms
- OCR support for scanned PDFs
- Additional formats (Markdown, HTML, plain text)
- Severity levels and per‑rule enable/disable
- CLI mode (run without Streamlit)
- Dockerfile for one‑command deployment
